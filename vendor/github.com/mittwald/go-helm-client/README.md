## Installation
Install this library using `go get`:

## Usage
Example usage of the client can be found in the [package examples](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/mittwald/go-helm-client?tab=doc#pkg-examples).

#### Private chart repository
When working with private repositories, you can utilize the `Username` and `Password` parameters of a chart entry to specify credentials.

An example of this can be found in the corresponding [example](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/mittwald/go-helm-client?tab=doc#example_HelmClient_AddOrUpdateChartRepo_private).

## Mock Client
This library includes a mock client [mock/interface_mock.go](mock/interface.go) which is generated by [mockgen](https://github.com/golang/mock).

Example usage of the mocked client can be found in [mock/mock_test.go](mock/mock_test.go).

If you made changes to [interface.go](./interface.go), you should issue the `make generate` command to trigger code generation.
