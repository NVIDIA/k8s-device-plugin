NVIDIA device plugin for Kubernetes

This file covers the **Go dependencies** of this project, with the verbatim text
of each one's license. Two surfaces are covered:

* **Runtime dependencies** — Go modules statically linked into the commands
  under `cmd/`, resolved as the union across every released image platform. All
  four of those commands — `nvidia-device-plugin`, `gpu-feature-discovery`,
  `mps-control-daemon` and `config-manager` — are copied into the released
  `k8s-device-plugin` image.
* **Build toolchain** — Go modules behind the helpers pinned in
  `deployments/devel/go.mod`. These run at build time and are not shipped in the
  released image; they are listed here so the full chain behind the released
  artifacts is attributable.

Go standard library packages are excluded; they are covered by the license of
the Go distribution itself.

Scope: this document does not inventory the non-Go contents of the released
container image — the packages inherited from its distroless base image, or the
statically linked BusyBox binary and its applet symlinks. Base image
dependencies are covered by that image's own compliance process, and BusyBox is
handled separately, including any source-distribution obligations it carries.
The end-to-end test suite under `tests/` is a separate Go module that is neither
built nor shipped as part of a release, so its dependencies are not listed here
either.

Go runtime entries identify their dependency as `module@version` rather than a
URL. `go-licenses` in vendor mode reports a link into this repository at `HEAD`,
which stops describing the released content once `main` advances;
`module@version` is immutable and names the upstream project directly.

This file is generated. Run `make notices` to regenerate it; `make
notices-check` verifies it is current.
