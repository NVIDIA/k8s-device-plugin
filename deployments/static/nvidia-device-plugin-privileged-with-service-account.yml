#
# == ABOUT THIS STATIC DEPLOYMENT
#
# The pod needs to run with privileged security context to be able to
# mount a hostPath volume. To avoid granting permissions too broadly,
# it is safer to deploy the pod in its own namespace with its own service
# account.
#
# This static deployment is aimed at OpenShift and creates:
#
#   - A namespace with the labels for the PodSecurity admission webhook
#   - A role that grants the read nodes resources and use the privileged
#     security context constraints (SCC) in Microshift.
#   - A service account that the pod will use to run in the namespace.
#   - A role binding to link the cluster role and the service account in
#     the scope of the namespace.
#   - The device plugin daemon set with the privileged security context
#     and the service account.
#
# The other attributes of the device plugin daemon set are unchanged from
# the standard static deployment definition with compatibility with CPU
# Manager.
#
# To deploy it in Microshift, simply put this file in
# /etc/microshift/manifests and add the file to the list of resources in
# your Kustomization resource.
#
# See Microshift documentation for more details on the automated
# deployment of resources:
# https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_build_of_microshift/
