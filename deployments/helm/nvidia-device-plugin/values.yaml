# Only one of "name" or "map" should ever be set for a given deployment.
# Use "name" to point to an external ConfigMap with a list of configurations.
# Use "map" to build an integrated ConfigMap from a set of configurations as
# part of this helm chart. An example of setting "map" might be:
# config:
#   map:
#     default: |-
#       version: v1
#       flags:
#         migStrategy: none
#     mig-single: |-

#       flags:
#         migStrategy: mixed
