# Release Process

The device plugin consists in two artifacts:
- The Device Plugin container
- The Device Plugin helm chart

Publishing the container is automated through gitlab-ci and only requires one to tag the commit and push it to gitlab.
Publishing the helm chart is currently manual, and we should move to an automated process ASAP
