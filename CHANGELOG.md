## Changelog

### Version v0.15.0-rc.1
- Import GPU Feature Discovery into the GPU Device Plugin repo. This means that
  the same version and container image is used for both components.
- Add tooling to create a kind cluster for local development and testing.
- Update `go-gpuallocator` dependency to migrate away from the deprecated `gpu-monitoring-tools` NVML bindings.
- Remove `legacyDaemonsetAPI` config option. This was only required for k8s versions < 1.16.
- Add support for MPS sharing.
- Bump CUDA base image version to 12.3.1

### Version v0.14.4

- Update to refactored go-gpuallocator code. This permanently fixes the NVML_NVLINK_MAX_LINKS value addressed in a
  hotfix in v0.14.3. This also addresses a bug due to uninitialized NVML when calling go-gpuallocator.

### Version v0.14.3

- Patch vendored code for new NVML_NVLINK_MAX_LINKS value
